This project manages a real estate corporation and its franchises.  
#### The application contains two main pages:  
1. Start page '/start': This page allows the user to manage corporations (add a new corporation), view franchises,
add anew franchise, and sort franchises by (sold homes, total commission, ..).
2. Franchise page '/franchise/{franchise-id}': This page accepts one parameter which is the id of the franchise. From this page, 
the user can edit the franchise details (address, country, ...), add a new transaction, and view the list of transaction 
created by this franchise.
